<div>
A domain to use when setting cookies, overriding the SSO Domain set in Crowd (since Crowd 2.5.2).
When an SSO Domain is set in Crowd, all client applications must be in the same domain so cookies can be shared.
A Crowd deployment may have hosts with no common domain suffix, for example 'domain.example.com' and 'domain.internal'. Even though a user has already logged in to 'domain.example.com' and has a cookie set, applications running under 'domain.internal' will not receive this cookie since the domains differ, and users will be unable to log in.
Set this property in the Crowd client application to override the domain. Applications within the same domain will then be able to share SSO sessions.
