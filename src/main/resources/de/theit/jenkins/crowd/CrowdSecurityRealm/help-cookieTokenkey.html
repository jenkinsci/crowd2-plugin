When using Crowd for single sign-on (SSO), you can specify the SSO cookie name for each application. Under the standard configuration, Crowd will use a single, default cookie name for all Crowd-connected applications. You can override the default with your own cookie name.
As well as allowing you to define the SSO cookie name, this feature also allows you to divide your applications into different SSO groups. For example, you might use one SSO token for your public websites and another for your internal websites.
