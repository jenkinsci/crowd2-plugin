## Version 1.4 (Nov 25, 2011)

-   Upgrade commons-httpclient version to 3.1.

## Version 1.3 (Oct 27, 2011)

Fixed the following bugs:

-   [JENKINS-11418](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-11418):
    Crowd2 doesn't always show full user name
-   [JENKINS-11507](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-11507):
    Single-sign-on isn't working correctly in the Crowd 2 plugin

## Version 1.2 (Oct 19, 2011)

-   Fixed a problem that prevented you at least from adding pre- or post
    build steps when reconfiguring a build job.
-   Added some debug log messages.

## Version 1.1 (Oct 11, 2011)

-   Fix for a problem that I discovered in combination with the
    [Email-ext
    plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin):
    Sending emails to the logged-in user was not possible because a
    lookup operation in the Crowd server for details about a user
    failed.
-   The Crowd user Id is now shown besides the display name of the
    logged-in user.
-   Added more debug log messages.

    The debug log messages are usually not shown in Jenkins' console
    output because they are logged with log level FINE or below. See
    [here](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging) how to enable
    them (the plugin uses logger classes `de.theit.jenkins.crowd.XXX`).

## Version 1.0 (Sep 23, 2011)

-   Initial release
