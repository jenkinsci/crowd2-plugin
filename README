crowd2-plugin for Jenkins
=========================

This plugin delegates the authentication to a remote Crowd server
(http://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd). With this setting, users can
login by entering their Crowd username and password.

This plugin supports single-sign-on and also allows you to use Crowd groups
for authorization. For example, you can say "everyone in the 'developers'
group will have the administrator access".
